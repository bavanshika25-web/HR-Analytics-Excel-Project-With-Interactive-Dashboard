HR Analytics Dashboard ‚Äì Excel Project üìä
Overview
This project analyzes employee attrition and workforce trends using Microsoft Excel on a dataset of approximately 1,470 employees. The goal is to provide actionable insights for HR and leadership teams to reduce turnover, enhance retention strategies, and support diversity and workforce planning. By leveraging Excel‚Äôs advanced features like Pivot Tables, Slicers, KPIs, and Conditional Formatting, this project delivers an interactive dashboard that transforms raw data into strategic business intelligence.
This project is ideal for demonstrating data analytics skills in HR/People Analytics, particularly for roles requiring Excel proficiency and business problem-solving.

üéØ Objectives

Analyze Attrition Drivers: Identify key factors contributing to employee turnover (e.g., department, age group, job role).
Support Retention Strategies: Highlight patterns in tenure, promotions, and satisfaction to improve employee retention.
Promote Diversity: Assess gender, education, and marital status distributions to identify potential biases.
Deliver Actionable Insights: Provide data-driven recommendations for HR decision-making via an interactive dashboard.


üìÇ Dataset and Structure
The dataset contains ~1,470 employee records with attributes such as:

Attrition: Yes/No (turnover indicator).
Department: Sales, R&D, HR, etc.
Age Band: Under 25, 25‚Äì34, 35‚Äì44, 45‚Äì54, Over 55.
Job Role: Sales Executive, Research Scientist, Laboratory Technician, Manager, etc.
Gender, Marital Status, Education Field, Overtime, Job Satisfaction, Monthly Income, Years at Company, and more.

The Excel workbook (HR Analytics Final Project (1).xlsx) is structured across 9 sheets:

Summary: Project overview, key insights, and outcomes.
Raw Data: Full dataset (~1,470 rows).
Filters and Slicers: Interactive filtering for dynamic analysis.
Conditional Formatting: Highlights risk factors (e.g., low satisfaction, long tenure).
KPI: Key metrics (e.g., Total Employees: ~1,470, Attrition Rate: ~22%).
Gender & Qualification: Breakdown by gender and education level.
Department: Attrition by department (e.g., Sales: 35 in sample).
Age & Marriage: Attrition by age group and marital status.
Dashboard: Interactive view with slicers, KPIs, and visual summaries.


üõ†Ô∏è Tools and Techniques

Excel Features:
Pivot Tables: Aggregate data by department, job role, age, etc.
Slicers: Enable one-click filtering for real-time exploration.
KPIs: Calculate metrics like attrition rate (Attrition Count / Total Employees).
Conditional Formatting: Highlight risks (e.g., low performance, long tenure without promotion).


Analytics Types:
Descriptive: Summarize workforce metrics (e.g., average age: ~37 years).
Diagnostic: Explain turnover patterns (e.g., 25‚Äì34 age group has high attrition due to burnout).
Prescriptive: Recommend strategies (e.g., address promotion gaps).




üîë Key Insights

Attrition Trends:
25‚Äì34 age group has the highest turnover, likely due to early-career burnout or unmet expectations.
Sales and R&D departments drive most attrition (e.g., 35 in Sales in sample).
Sales Executives (21) and Sales Representatives (12) are high-risk roles.


Demographics:
Gender skew in some roles (90 Male vs. 69 Female in sample).
Single employees show higher attrition (20) vs. Married (10) or Divorced (5).


Education: Higher education (e.g., Bachelor‚Äôs Degree: 15 attrition) doesn‚Äôt always correlate with retention.
Engagement Risks: Long-tenured employees without promotions are at risk of disengagement.


üìä Dashboard Features

Interactive Slicers: Filter by department, age, job role, or marital status.
KPIs: Display Total Employees (1,470), Attrition Count (237), Attrition Rate (22%), Average Age (37).
Visual Summaries: Pivot-based tables for quick insights (charts implied but not explicitly included in sample).
Conditional Formatting: Highlights employees with low satisfaction or high turnover risk.


‚úÖ Recommendations

Retention Focus: Implement early-career support programs for the 25‚Äì34 age group.
Department Strategy: Address turnover in Sales and R&D through targeted engagement initiatives.
Promotion Cycles: Reduce disengagement by ensuring timely promotions for long-tenured employees.
Diversity Efforts: Investigate gender and education biases in hiring and promotions.


üìò How to Use

Open the Workbook: Download HR Analytics Final Project (1).xlsx and open in Microsoft Excel.
Explore the Dashboard: Navigate to the Dashboard sheet and use slicers to filter by department, age, job role, etc.
Review Insights: Check the Summary sheet for key findings and recommendations.
Analyze Breakdowns: Visit sheets like Gender & Qualification, Department, or Age & Marriage for detailed views.
Inspect Raw Data: Refer to the Raw Data sheet for the full dataset.


üöÄ Potential Extensions

Migrate to Google Sheets for compatibility with Google‚Äôs ecosystem.
Add charts (e.g., bar charts for attrition by department) using Excel‚Äôs charting tools.
Incorporate basic statistical functions (e.g., CORREL for overtime vs. attrition).
Scale to SQL or Python (Pandas) for larger datasets or predictive modeling.
Address data privacy by ensuring anonymization (already assumed in dataset).
